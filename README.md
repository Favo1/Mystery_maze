# Maze-V1
 Maze Game V1 Project

Main menu: START DIFFICULTY EXIT VOLUME

Controls: Player controls are defined as the Arrow Keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)

Maze Generation algorithm: The maze is generated using DFS(Depth-First=Search) Algorithm. 
First, we select a path in the maze (for the sake of the example, let's choose a path according to some rule we lay out ahead of time) 
and we follow it until we hit a dead end or reach the finishing point of the maze.

 Aim & Objectives:
Complete the maze in a given amount of time nased on player's chosen difficulty 
this can be changed at the beginning of the game in the game start menu (Easy(120 Seconds), Medium(60Seconds), Hard(30Seconds))
