 Maze Game V1 Project

Main menu: 
START DIFFICULTY EXIT VOLUME
Controls: Player controls are defined as the Arrow Keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
Volume: (Left arrow = -) (Right arrow = +)

Maze Generation algorithm: 
The maze is generated using DFS(Depth-First=Search) Algorithm. 
First, we select a path in the maze (for the sake of the example, let's choose a path according to some rule we lay out ahead of time) 
and we follow it until we hit a dead end or reach the finishing point of the maze.

 Aim & Objectives:
Complete the maze in a given amount of time based on player's chosen difficulty (Easy(120 Seconds), Medium(60Seconds), Hard(30Seconds)).
Eat the watermelons to increase game score status.
Complete level maze to increase level status.
